# React Application using Vite

This is a simple React application built using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-vite-react-app.git
   cd your-vite-react-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open your app in your default web browser.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run serve`: Serve the built app locally.
- `npm run test`: Run your test suite.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to lint your code.

## Customizing Configuration

You can customize the Vite configuration by editing the `vite.config.js` file. Check out the [Vite Configuration Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information.

## Deployment

To deploy your app, build it first using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized production-ready assets in the `dist/` folder. You can then deploy these files to your hosting platform of choice.
